# Overview

My Django portfolio project is a web application that allows me to showcase my work. It used the Django framework, which is a popular and powerful web framework for building web applications. It uses dynamically build pages through the use of templates and a sql lite database. The project also allows me to create and edit portfolio items through the admin page. The project uses bootstrap to style the pages and make them responsive.

# Web Pages

The site contains a home page that has card for each project in the database. The page is created dynamically. Each card has a details page based on a template that shows an image, some info about the project, the technology used and a link to the source code on github.
