        <p>My name is McKay and I am a highly motivated individual with a passion for problem-solving and a love for technology.</p>
        <p>As a software engineer, I am constantly striving to improve my skills and knowledge in order to better serve my clients and colleagues. I am always on the lookout for new challenges and opportunities to learn and grow.
        </p>
        <p>In my free time, I enjoy rock climbing as it allows me to push my physical and mental limits while also enjoying the great outdoors. I find it to be a great way to clear my mind and come up with new ideas.</p>
        <p>Another hobby of mine is designing systems in my homelab, I find it to be a great way to learn new technologies and develop my skills in a hands-on way.</p>
        <p>I am excited to share with you some of my previous work and projects, as well as my experience and skills. I am always open to new opportunities and am available for hire. Thank you for visiting my portfolio, and I look forward to connecting with you.</p>
